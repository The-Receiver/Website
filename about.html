        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>
        We, Myanmar Children Health Project (MCHP), are a student-led <strong>not-for-profit</strong>
        <br>organization committed to maintaining the overall health and welfare of children
        <br>living in rural areas of Myanmar through vaccinations provided by certified doctors.
        <br>As of now we are currently focused on Hepatitis B.

        <h1>What do we do?</h1>
        <p>
        Every month, we host three vaccination events at a designated area. In the first event,
        <br>certified doctors from Myanmar Pharmaceutical Industries for Hepatitis B come to test the
        <br>children for Hepatitis B and provide vaccinations against Hepatitis B. In the second event,
        <br>which is a month later, the children get vaccinated again. The third event is the same but
        <br>occurs six months after the first event. During the events, MCHP members comfort crying
        <br>children and socialize with them. In addition to that, MCHP members educate the community
        <br>about essential health information such as sanitation and nutrition. The task of vaccinating
        <br>the children is done by certified doctors â€“ not MCHP members.

        <h1>Why Hepatitis B?</h1>
        <p>
        Hepatitis B is an infection that harms the liver which is spread through contact with body
        <br>fluids. It can be easily transmitted through infected blood products such as needles, razors,
        <br>and unscreened blood transfusions. Although there is no cure for acute Hepatitis B, it can
        <br>be prevented through vaccinations. We are currently focused on Hepatitis B due to the lack of
        <br>government attention in its prevention, as the prevention of most other fatal diseases in
        <br>Myanmar are sponsored by the Burmese government.
